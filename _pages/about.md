I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Northeastern University.  My research interest lies in information transmission and privacy, platform economy, digital marketing and competitive marketing strategy.

My current research examines how the creation of virtual brands by the firm and the selective recommendation by the platform interact with each other under different privacy environment and the welfare consequences on consumers, the firm and the platform.
